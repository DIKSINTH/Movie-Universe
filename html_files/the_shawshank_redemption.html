 <center><p><span>The Shawshank Redemption</span> is a 1994 American prison drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont.</p></center>
 <center><b><h1>STORY</h1></b></center>
 <center><p>banker Andy Dufresne , who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary 
 for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he
 befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis "Red" Redding, and becomes instrumental in a money laundering
 operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton.</p></center><br>
 <center><b><h1>CRITICS</h1></b></center>
 <center><p>While The Shawshank Redemption received critical acclaim upon its release particularly 
 for its story, the performances of Robbins and Freeman, Newman's score, Darabont's direction and screenplay 
 and Roger Deakins cinematography.</p></center>
 <center><b><h1>BOX OFFICE</h1></b></center>
 <center><p>the film was a box-office disappointment, earning only $16 million during 
 its initial theatrical run. Many reasons were cited for its failure at the time, including competition from
 the films Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump, the general unpopularity of prison films, and even the title, which was considered to be confusing for audiences. Theatrical re-release that, increased the film's box-office gross to $73.3 million.</p></center><br>
